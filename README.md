# Chess end game King Rook King
Project is focused on creating a machine learning program that will estimate the number of moves necessary for
a given record from a chess data set. In general, this project shows how well can machine learning
algorithm predict the chess KRK (King-Rook vs King) outcome based on position of pieces on the
board.

Algorithms used:

-Multiclass Logistic Regression 

-Random Forest

-XGBoost
